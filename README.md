# This is NOT Official AxMinions Repository

This repository is a fork intended to fix issues and add features for the servers I manage.
Feel free to compile it. I also took the time to update some dependencies.

> [!NOTE]
> A PR **WON'T** be made to original AxMinions repository. The support for lower versions on this fork has been reduced in order to support a better scalability and a smoother maintenance, what understandbly may not reach the standards of Artillex Studios regarding to version compatibility.
